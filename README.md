## Flashcards
### Abstract
Flashcards simulates a set of flash cards through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round along with how long it took them to answer. 

### Goals and Objectives
 -   Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
-   Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
-   Implement ES6 classes
-   Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
-   Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

## Fork This Repo

On the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button.

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal: 

```bash
node index.js
```

```bash
Node server running on port 3000
```

When the game is functioning appropriately, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:
